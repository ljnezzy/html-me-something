                <p>This is, perhaps, the most recognizable sportscard in the entire hobby and the anchor of the most important post-war set in existence. Strangely enough, it is not Mickey Mantle's official rookie card, but there is no question that it is the slugger's most important card. Despite a couple of major finds of 1952 Topps cards during the last 25 years, this card has remained difficult to obtain in NM-MT or better condition as many of those find examples exhibit poor centering. There are actually two different versions of this doubleprinted card. The line surrounding the Yankee logo is a solid black on one version, while the other version has a line that is only partially filled. There is also a slight variance in color and focus between the two. Despite the minor difference in appearance, there is no difference in market value. Most of the high-grade examples found today were a product of either the large 1952 Topps find from the New England area during the 1980s or a few smaller finds from Canada over the last two decades. After slugging .530 in 1952, Mantle was well on his way to stardom. This would be the first of 16 All-Star selections for the Yankee Slugger, a man who made the #7 famous.

                <p>This is the only recognized rookie card of The Hammer. Even though his career home run mark of 755 has now been eclipsed by Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron remains a symbol of class, consistency and grace. In 1954, Aaron's debut season, he hit a mere 13 home runs in 122 games. From that point on, Aaron hit no less than 20 homers in a season until 1975! His tremendous hand and wrist strength enabled him to turn on inside fastballs with incredible quickness. With all of his home runs, Aaron never struck out 100 times in a season and was an outstanding all-around player. During his career, he won three Gold Gloves, hit .305, amassed 3,771 hits, 2,297 RBI, scored 2,174 runs, stole 240 bases and won the NL MVP in 1957. Aaron made 24 All-Star appearances during his amazing career and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. This card is one of the true classics in the hobby. While not nearly as tough as some of the other vintage cards on the list, finding well-centered, high-end copies can be a challenge. This card is the heart and soul of the 1954 Topps set and the image is unforgettable.Courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psacard.com/cardfacts/baseball-cards/1954-topps/henry-aaron-128/24452">PSA</a></p>

                <p>This is one of Jackie's best looking cards in one of the hobby's most important issues. In 1952, Robinson hit .308 with 19 home runs, 24 stolen bases, 104 runs scored and a league-high .440 OBP. These are outstanding numbers for a second baseman. One of Robinson's more impressive statistics is the fact that he only struck out 291 times with nearly 5,000 at-bats in his career, which shows he had serious bat control. It's too bad fans didn't get to see Robinson for a full career in MLB. There's no question Robinson could have put up huge numbers, especially at his position. Because of his long-lasting impact on the game, MLB retired his number (42) in 1997 on the 50th anniversary of his debut for the Brooklyn Dodgers. This card captures a joyous Robinson, who always found a way to smile despite enduring so much torment from hateful folks. All we can do as collectors is continue to appreciate what he did and thank him for helping make the game better.

                <p>This is the only recognized rookie card of baseball's strikeout king. Nolan Ryan was a physical marvel. Still able to throw in the mid-90s well into his 40s, Ryan baffled hitters for four decades. In 1993, his pitching arm finally gave out when he suffered a sudden elbow tear, ending his career. Ryan finished with 324 wins, a 3.19 ERA, 5,714 strikeouts and seven no-hitters. His strikeout total is one of those records that seems unbreakable. Consider this. If you struck out 250 batters for 20 consecutive seasons, that would get you to 5,000. You then would have to add another 714 strikeouts to tie Ryan. It defies logic! This humble cowboy from Texas never had the chance to pitch for a great team, resulting in an unspectacular won/loss record of 324-292. This eight-time All-Star and owner of dozens of MLB records was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999. This card, one that also pictures another fine pitcher in Jerry Koosman, is not overly tough to find in PSA NM-MT 8 condition, but collectors should look for well-centered copies and be aware of chipping along the colored reverse. In addition, due to the print design along the borders, corner wear may be hard to detect at first glance.Courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psacard.com/cardfacts/baseball-cards/1968-topps/mets-rookies-j-koosman-n-ryan-177/31778">PSA</a>

                <p>Ken Griffey, Jr. (November 21, 1969-) and Ken Griffey, Sr. became the first father/son duo to play in the Major Leagues at the same time, the same lineup at the same time and are the first to hit home runs in the same game when playing for Seattle in September of 1990. The Seattle Mariners selected Junior with the #1 overall pick of the 1987 MLB June Amateur Draft after Griffey was named the United States High School Baseball Player of the Year. Junior grew up in the Cincinnati area as his father played for the Cincinnati Reds during the mid-1970s and was in the clubhouse as the Reds won back-to-back World Series titles in 1975 and 1976. After being drafted, Ken made his first appearance on the field in Atlanta where Ken, Sr. was playing as a backup. Hall of Fame slugger Willie Stargell, coach for the Braves, took the young hitter out past second and taught him how to play the outfield, &quot;get his footwork down and teach him how to play some hops.&quot; Known as Junior or &quot;The Kid&quot;, Griffey saved baseball in Seattle with his amazingly long, smooth and powerful home run swing and his exceptional defensive ability robbing hitters of so many potential home runs as he climbed the walls at the King Dome. Ken thrilled fans with the Mariners for 11 seasons to start his career, earning All-Star Game selections each year after his rookie campaign, led the American League four times in home runs and once each in runs scored and RBI. In all, he was a 13-time All-Star, won ten Gold Gloves, seven Silver Sluggers and was the 1997 AL Most Valuable Player as he led the AL in runs (125), RBI (147) and home runs (56).
                Ken left the Northwest to return to the Cincinnati Area and play for his hometown team, but struggled to put a full season together as injuries began to take their toll on his body. Junior played 22 seasons in the Major Leagues with the Mariners (1989-1999, 2009-2010), the Cincinnati Reds (2000-2008) and the Chicago White Sox (2008). Junior&apos;s sweet home run swing made him a perennial fan favorite at the All-Star Games where he won three Home Run Derbies and the 1992 MVP Award. During the 1998 MLB season when St. Louis Cardinals Mark McGwire and Chicago Cubs Sammy Sosa chased Roger Maris&apos; single season home runs record, Griffey was the third player chasing history until he slumped in August and was left behind yet still hit 56 round-trippers. Ken Griffey Jr. was one of the greatest players of his generation, finishing his 22-year career with .284 career batting average, had 2,781 hits including 524 doubles and 630 home runs, 184 stolen bases and 1,836 RBI. He also posted a .985 fielding percentage with 5,606 putouts, 154 assists, 43 double plays and 89 errors in 5,849 chances. In June of 2009, during his second stint with the Mariners to finish his career, Griffey hit the 5000th home runs in franchise history. In 1999, Griffey was named to Major League Baseball&apos;s All-Century Team with some of the greatest players in the history of baseball. In 2016, as expected, Ken Griffey, Jr. was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame with the highest voter rate in the history on the Hall at 99.3% - 437 votes out of 440. His induction was one of the most anticipated in history as fans and the media speculated whether he would be the first player ever to be voted in unanimously. And, while the baseball world wondered who the three writers were that failed to list The Kid on their ballots, Griffey, Jr. joined Mike Piazza (also inducted in 2016) as a member of one of the most elite clubs in the world.

                <p>This is the key rookie card of baseball's greatest leadoff man. Rickey Henderson, who played an amazing 25 years, combined power and speed at the top of the lineup for nearly three full decades. Henderson finished his career with 1,406 stolen bases (#1 all-time), 3,055 hits, 2,295 runs scored (#1 all-time), 2,190 walks, a .401 on-base percentage and 297 home runs. In fact, he led off a game with a home run 81 times, the MLB record. This 10-time All-Star led the league in stolen bases 12 times and he still holds the record for stolen bases in a season with 130, a number that seems unreachable in today's game. In 1990, Henderson won the AL MVP as a member of the Oakland A's by hitting .325 with 28 home runs, 119 runs scored, 65 stolen bases and a .439 OBP. This card is fairly tough to find centered by modern standards and the 1980 Topps card was often cut in a manner that left the corners with a blunt appearance. In addition, print defects are found on this card from time to time but, since the image of Henderson was taken from a distance, the presence of such defects may not affect the eye-appeal quite as much as they would on a portrait-style image. Finally, this card has been counterfeited - so beware. Courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psacard.com/cardfacts/baseball-cards/1980-topps/rickey-henderson-482/37164">PSA</a>

This classic set is filled with Hall of Fame rookies and a great selection of star cards, despite the absence of Mickey Mantle and Stan Musial. But these two Williams cards stand out. The #250 card was long believed to be the tougher of the two, but that theory has changed since the advent of Population Reports for graded cards. These cards measure approximately 2 5/8" by 3 ¾". Both cards are commonly found off-center with some degree of chipping along the green reverse. The presence of chipping, as long as it is not severe, will not detract from the overall grade of the card. Since the #250 card has a bright yellow background, be wary of print defects that may hinder the eye-appeal.Courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psacard.com/cardfacts/baseball-cards/1954-topps/ted-williams-1/24275">PSA</a>

                <p>Vincent Edward &quot;Bo&quot; Jackson (November 30, 1962-) is a former Major League Baseball and National Football League player, the first two-sport All-Star, and a Heisman Trophy recipient. Jackson played both baseball and football at Auburn University. He barely edged out University of Iowa quarterback Chuck Long for the 1985 Heisman Trophy. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers took Jackson in the 1st round (1st overall) of the 1986 NFL Draft, but Bo instead joined the Kansas City Royals (1986-1990), which selected him in the 4th round of the 1986 MLB amateur draft. His best season on the green diamond unquestionably came in 1989, when he was voted to start for the American League All-Star team and earned Most Valuable Player honors. He and Wade Boggs also hit back-to-back home runs, becoming the first duo in All-Star history to lead off their side's first inning with back-to-back homers. In a 1990 game against the Baltimore Orioles, Jackson performed his now-famous "wall run," when he caught a ball a few strides away from the wall. As he caught the ball, he noticed the wall and began to run along it, almost parallel to the ground, and came down with the catch. He finished his career with the Chicago White Sox (1991, 1993) and California Angels (1994). In his eight baseball seasons, Jackson had a .250 batting average, hit 141 home runs, and had 415 RBI. Jackson was also a running back for the Los Angeles Raiders (1987-1990), where he rushed for 2,782 yards with 16 touchdowns. A 1990 post season tackle resulted in a hip injury that ended his football career and shortened his baseball career. In 1989 and 1990, Jackson's name became known beyond just sports fans through the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; Nike advertising campaign to promote a cross-training athletic shoe named in his honor.

                <p>Roberto Clemente Walker (1934-1972) is widely considered the greatest Latin player to ever put on a Major League Baseball uniform with a .317 career batting average, a .973 fielding percentage and a record 254 career assists for a right fielder. In his native Puerto Rico, Clemente played for the Santurce Cangrejeros ("Crabbers") before signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954. While coming off the bench for the Montreal Royals, Brooklyn&apos;s minor league affiliate, the Pittsburgh Pirates took Roberto in the 1954 Rule 5 Draft offering him the opportunity to play everyday and win the right field position at the 1955 spring training. Clemente never played a minor league game again as he easily won the right field job and batted .255 with 121 hits and 47 RBI as a rookie. Though he hit .311 in 1956, Roberto’s break out year came in 1960 when he earned his first of 15 All-Star Game selections after batting .314 with 16 home runs and 94 RBI. He helped lead the Pirates to their first World Series title that year as they captured MLB&apos;s top prize in dramatic fashion with Bill Mazeroski&apos;s Game 7 walk-off series clinching home run. Clemente hit .310 with three RBI in the 1960 World Series. In 1961, Roberto hit 23 home run and hit .351 to lead the National League for the first of four times during the 1960s.  He was a perennial vote-getter for National League MVP and in 1966, after leading the league in batting average the previous two seasons, won the award with a .317 average, 31 home runs and 119 RBI while also posting 17 outfield assists. The 12-time Rawlings Gold Glove recipient played his entire career with Pittsburgh (1955-1972) and helped lead them to a second World Series title in 1971. Roberto Clemente collected 3,000 hits, hit 240 home runs, had 1.305 RBI and batted .317 over 18-year seasons with the Buccos. Above and beyond his numbers at the plate, Bob possessed a powerful and precise arm that helped him achieve a .973 fielding percentage with 4,696 putouts. Clemente was heavily involved in humanitarian efforts in the third world Latin American countries and was killed on December 31, 1972 assisting in delivering aid to Nicaragua after an earthquake devastated the small country. Major League Baseball presents The Roberto Clemente Award to the player that best exemplifies Clemente&apos;s humanitarian efforts. Roberto Clemente Walker was posthumously elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973.

                <p>This is the first Topps card to feature Willie Mays, coming only one year after his Bowman rookie offering. Some players create moments for themselves that are remembered for eternity, and Mays was one of them. In 1954, during the World Series against Cleveland with the score tied at 2-2, Vic Wertz drove a pitch from reliever Don Liddle about 450 feet to centerfield. With runners on first and second, it appeared as if Cleveland was going to take the lead after Wertz made contact. With Mays playing shallow, it was believed that no one could catch up to this majestic drive, but Mays never gave up. He started running like a sprinter the moment the ball was hit and miraculously outran the ball, making an improbable over-the-shoulder catch and firing the ball back into the infield to preserve the tie. The Giants would go on to win the game 5-2, and the image of Mays making what is now referred to as The Catch will forever be remembered. This card, while not Willie's toughest, is prone to tilt or diamond cuts resulting in centering problems.
